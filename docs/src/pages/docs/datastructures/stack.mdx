# Stack

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
The order may be **LIFO(Last In First Out)** or **FILO(First In Last Out)**.
**LIFO** implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and **FILO** implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.

## Operations

- **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
- **Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it.
- **Clear**: Empty the stack.
- **IsEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
